# How to use

In order to install my dotfiles, you first need to clone the repository :

    git clone https://github.com/Reyshyram/Dotfiles.git
Then, cd into the directory containing the dotfiles :

    cd Dotfiles
Finally, launch the install script :

    ./install.sh
You will need to relaunch the install script when a big "Oh My Zosh" text appear in order to complete the installation.

## Compatibility
This script is only confirmed to be working under Fedora 39 and Gnome 45, because it uses dnf in order to install the required packages.
